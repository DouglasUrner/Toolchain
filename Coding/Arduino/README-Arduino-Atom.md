# Notes On Doing Arduino Development With Atom

## PlatformIO

There seem to be two approaches to using the PlatformIO tools for Arduino development with Atom. The "offical" package [platformio-ide][] claims to provide an Atom based IDE (maybe even using the Atom IDE package) but it is too intrusive for my taste. There is an alternative  [platformio][platformio-atom] that uses the PlatformIO command line tools with a simple, non-intrusive, UI – for now, at least, it wins.

[PlatformIO][platformio-org] is also one of the ways to do Arduino development using CLion.
