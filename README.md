# Toolchain

Notes on my long (and tangled) toolchain.

## Projects / Needs / Goals…

* Editing Markdown
* Creating presentations – mostly for coding
* Java (AP Computer Science)
* C# (Unity)
* C and C++ (Arduino)
* Ruby (Canvas)
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and friends
* Lab (Windows) management

Integration with Git and GitHub is a big deal and I'd like to have everything working in Atom – even though for coding I primarily use JetBrains IDEs. Partly the two editors have different use cases – among other things Atom is blindly fast compared to any of the JetBrains IDEs. Also, using two different sets of tools makes it harder to get "caught" in the ways of one set of tools.

The platform I really care about is Unix/macOS, but I do have to work on Windows, so cross-platform tools count for a lot.

## Editing Markdown

[Atom][] is close to my editor of choice (it reminds me of emacs). These two posts were helpful in selecting packages for working in Markdown:

* [Turn Atom into the Best Markdown Editor for Mac][bd5237b3]
* [Use Atom as your Markdown editor][a2abaecd]

A folding editor is a big deal.

## Code Editing

For "purpose built" IDEs the [JetBrains][1a422cf3] tools are hard to beat.
