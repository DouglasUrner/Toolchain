## Writing

### Editing Markdown

[Atom][] is close to my editor of choice (it reminds me of emacs). These two posts were helpful in selecting packages for working in Markdown:

* [Turn Atom into the Best Markdown Editor for Mac][bd5237b3]
* [Use Atom as your Markdown editor][a2abaecd]

A folding editor is a big deal.

Converting between text formats: [Pandoc][]
