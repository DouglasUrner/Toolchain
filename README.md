# Toolchain

Notes on my long (and tangled) toolchain.

## Projects / Needs / Goalsâ€¦

  - Ruby (Canvas)
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and friends
* Configuration Management
  - Dot Files
  - Lab Images

## Editing Markdown

[Atom][] is close to my editor of choice (it reminds me of emacs). These two posts were helpful in selecting packages for working in Markdown:

* [Turn Atom into the Best Markdown Editor for Mac][bd5237b3]
* [Use Atom as your Markdown editor][a2abaecd]

A folding editor is a big deal.

Converting between text formats: [Pandoc][]

## Code Editing

For "purpose built" IDEs the [JetBrains][1a422cf3] tools are hard to beat.
