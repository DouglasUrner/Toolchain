# Toolchain

Notes on my long (and tangled) toolchain.

## Projects / Needs / Goalsâ€¦

* Writing
    * Markdown
* Coding
    * Java (AP Computer Science)
    * C# (Unity)
    * C and C++ (Arduino)
    * Ruby (Canvas)
    * HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and friends

## Editing Markdown

[Atom][] is close to my editor of choice (it reminds me of emacs). These two posts were helpful in selecting packages for working in Markdown:

* [Turn Atom into the Best Markdown Editor for Mac][bd5237b3]
* [Use Atom as your Markdown editor][a2abaecd]

## Code Editing

For "purpose built" IDEs the [JetBrains][1a422cf3] tools are hard to beat.
