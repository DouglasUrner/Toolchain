## Editing Markdown

[Atom](https://atom.io) is close to my editor of choice (it reminds me of emacs). These two posts were helpful in selecting packages for working in Markdown:

* [Turn Atom into the Best Markdown Editor for Mac](https://www.news47ell.com/how-to/atom-best-markdown-editor-mac/)
* [Use Atom as your Markdown editor](https://discountry.github.io/2017/02/15/use-atom-as-your-markdown-editor/)
